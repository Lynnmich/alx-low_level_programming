# Low-Level Programming & Algorithm Project Overview

### The Low-Level Programming & Algorithm repository consisted of several projects that focused on low-level programming concepts and algorithmic problem-solving. These projects provided a deep understanding of programming in the C language, data structures, algorithms, and system programming in Linux and Unix environments. Here's an overview of the projects undertaken:

### Hatching Out

***C Programming***

**Hello, World:** Introduced the basics of C programming with a "Hello, World!" program.

**Variables, if, else, while:** Covered variable declaration, conditional statements, and loops in C.

**Functions, nested loops:** Explored functions and nested loops in C.

**Debugging:** Focused on debugging techniques and strategies in C.

**More functions, more nested loops:** Expanded on functions and nested loops in C.

**Pointers, arrays, and strings:** Covered pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

**More pointers, arrays, and strings:** Advanced usage of pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

**Even more pointers, arrays, and strings:** Further explored pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

**Recursion:** Introduced recursion and its implementation in C.

**argc, argv:** Covered command-line argument passing in C.

**Static libraries:** Explored the creation and usage of static libraries in C.

**malloc, free:** Focused on dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using malloc and free.

**More malloc, free:** Advanced usage of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

**Structures, typedef:** Introduced structures and typedef in C.

**Preprocessor:** Covered the C preprocessor and its directives.

**Function pointers:** Explored function pointers in C.

**Variadic functions:** Covered variadic functions and their usage in C.

**printf:** Delved into the inner workings of the printf function.

**Bit manipulation:** Explored bit manipulation techniques in C.

**Dynamic libraries:** Introduced dynamic libraries and their usage in C.

**Makefiles:** Covered the creation and usage of Makefiles for building projects.

***Data Structures and Algorithms***

**Singly linked lists:** Implemented and manipulated singly linked lists in C.

**More singly linked lists:** Expanded on singly linked list functionality and operations.

**Doubly linked lists:** Implemented and manipulated doubly linked lists in C.

**Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO:** Implemented stacks and queues with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) behavior.

**Hash tables:** Implemented hash tables in C.

**Sorting algorithms & Big O:** Explored sorting algorithms and analyzed their Big O complexity.

**Binary trees:** Implemented binary trees and various tree-related operations.

**Search Algorithms:** Covered different search algorithms for efficient data retrieval.

***Linux and Unix System Programming***

**File I/O:** Explored file input/output operations in C.

**Simple Shell:** Implemented a simple Unix shell in C.
